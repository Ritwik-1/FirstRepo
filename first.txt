git repository : is basically a folder , which saves all the changes(history) which are done to a project by any 
		     user who is part of that project.

1) git init : To initialize a git repository for the current working folder/project
		  cd to the folder and type git init , a hidden file .git will be created in that folder 
              which can be seen via ls -a
2) git status : all the files which were modified appear in red and if they are staged for commit then they appear in green
		    
3) git add . : adds all the untracked / unstaged files to the stage
   git add file1 file 2 : another way to add only specific files.
   git restore --staged filename1 filename2 .. : unstage/untrack file for it to be commited.

4) git commit -m "message" : commit the change to the repo

5) git log : prints history of all commits by all users.

6) git reset [hashnumber] : each commit has a unique hashnumber displayed when we do "git log"
				    this command is used to delete/unstage all commits from log above 
				    a particular commit( as we cannot remove a commit from inbetween)
7) stashing : say you made some changes in the files and do not want to commit that now and want to do that later 
		  then we can add those changes to backstage sort of area and finally we would be left with only the progress which 
		  we had made before this.
		  we can pop this stash and get all the backstage changes to the present project again
		  we can also clear this stash by a command which will delete all these backstage changes forever
		  git stash
		  git stash pop
		  git stash clear

8) git remote add origin https://github.com/Ritwik-1/FirstRepo.git : here origin is the name of the link
										      
9) git remote -v : to check the fetch and pull url associated with the repo

10) master is the main branch we can create more branches of the main branch and can do work on it seperately
    and then merge that branch to the main branch once we are sure to make the main master branch correct always

11) git push origin master : to push the commit made to the project on github / (origin url)
